# AI4EU Robotics Pilot: Datasets & Models

The AI4EU Robotics pilot collected datasets of vibration sensor data for two robotics demonstrators: a pump demonstrator and a wrist demonstrator.

## Directory `dataset`

This repository contains a script to convert the full time-series datasets into more convenient formats, i.e. one sample per time-series, either in raw data or in frequency-space through FFT.

It also contains the recipes and scripts to create data brokers for the AI4EU Experiments platform.
